## üéØ About

Youth Opportunities Uniting Talent & Hope is a comprehensive platform designed to empower young people globally by linking them to valuable opportunities like scholarships, internships, and jobs. Founded in 2024, this youth-led platform goes beyond simple opportunity listing to provide a guided, community-driven empowerment forum that helps youth prepare for and succeed in their applications.

## üåü Mission Statement

Our mission is to empower young people globally by linking them to valuable opportunities like scholarships, internships, and jobs, and providing them with the training, mentorship, and support they need to leverage those opportunities to their advantage. We aim to close the readiness and opportunity gap by developing an online space where youth can:

- Access curated opportunities
- Create comprehensive profiles
- Be matched with rigorously curated resources
- Receive guidance and support
- Interact with peers in a positive and safe community

This mission directly addresses the top priority youth issues identified by the African Leadership University (ALU) Grand Challenges: **Youth Unemployment**, **Access to Education**, and **Technology**.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON youth_opportunities.* TO 'youth_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Step 5: Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (same level as backend folder):
```env
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
DB_USER=youth_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
