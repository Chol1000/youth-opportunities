## 🎯 Project Hypothesis

If we create and launch a scalable, community-based platform that links global youth to opportunity listings, mentorship, and skill-building tools—and also facilitates peer collaboration and community-based sharing—then more youth will not only be able to find these opportunities but will also have the support and preparation necessary to thrive in them.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Higher application success rates
- Improved career-readiness among youth
- More engaged global youth community
- Decreased youth unemployment
- Expanded access to quality education
- Enhanced economic mobility for underserved communities
